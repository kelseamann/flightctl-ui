# Flight Control UI

Monorepo containing UIs for [Flight Control](https://github.com/flightctl/flightctl)

## Prerequisites

- `Git`, `Node.js v22.x`, `npm v10.x`, `rsync`, `go` (>= 1.24)

## Contributing / offline development (no cluster)

If you are working from a fork without access to a Flight Control API, use the **mock proxy** so the UI runs against static JSON fixtures:

```shell
npm ci
npm run dev:mock
```

Open **http://localhost:9000** (the proxy on port 3001 runs in the background; there is no page to visit there).

See **[CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md)** for setup, troubleshooting, extending fixtures, and when to switch to a real `FLIGHTCTL_SERVER`.

## Building

### JavaScript/TypeScript Applications

Checkout the repository and run:

```shell
cd flightctl-ui
npm ci
npm run build
```

### Container Images (EDM-3308: EL9/EL10 Support)

The UI supports building containers for both Enterprise Linux 9 and 10. Containerfiles are organized by OS in a directory structure similar to the main FlightCtl repository:

```text
packaging/images/el9/Containerfile       # EL9 standalone UI
packaging/images/el9/Containerfile.ocp   # EL9 OCP plugin UI
packaging/images/el10/Containerfile      # EL10 standalone UI
packaging/images/el10/Containerfile.ocp  # EL10 OCP plugin UI
```

Use the provided Makefile:

```shell
# Build for specific OS (default: el9)
make build-ui OS=el9        # Standalone UI for EL9
make build-ui OS=el10       # Standalone UI for EL10
make build-ocp-ui OS=el9    # OCP Plugin UI for EL9
make build-ocp-ui OS=el10   # OCP Plugin UI for EL10

# Build all variants
make build-all

# Show available targets
make help
```

Built images will use OS-qualified names:
- `localhost/flightctl-ui-el9:latest` and `localhost/flightctl-ocp-ui-el9:latest`
- `localhost/flightctl-ui-el10:latest` and `localhost/flightctl-ocp-ui-el10:latest`

### Running Standalone UI with backend running in Kind

If backend is running in your Kind cluster, use the following command to start the UI application.
It will automatically detect your Flight Control deployment settings and it will configure the UI accordingly. (Requires `kind`, `kubectl`)

```shell
npm run dev:kind
```

See [CONFIGURATION.md](CONFIGURATION.md) for complete configuration options.

### Running Standalone UI with backend not running in Kind

If backend is not running in your Kind cluster, you need to specify your Flight Control deployment settings.

```shell
FLIGHTCTL_SERVER=<api_server_url> npm run dev
```

If the backend, or Auth provider is running self-signed certs, you will need to disable the verification via environment variables:

- `FLIGHTCTL_SERVER_INSECURE_SKIP_VERIFY='true'` - to disable verification of backend certs
- `AUTH_INSECURE_SKIP_VERIFY='true'` - to disable verification of auth server certs

or provide the CA certs:

- copy backend `ca.crt` to `./certs/ca.crt`
- copy Auth `ca.crt` to `./certs/ca_auth.crt`

See [CONFIGURATION.md](CONFIGURATION.md) for complete configuration options.

### Running UI as OCP plugin

With this option, the Flight Control UI will run as a Plugin in the OCP console.
**Note**: this setup is only for development, do not use it in Production environments!

Login to OCP cluster and run:

```shell
npm run dev:ocp
```

By default, the latest available OpenShift console image will be used. To specify a different console version, set the `CONSOLE_VERSION` environment variable.

The following console versions are confirmed to be compatible: 4.16 to 4.20.
